# OLAC-Validation-files
Open Language Archives Validation files

There are three folders in this repo.  `1.1` is the current (January 2023) version which is active. `1.x` contains the development versions which are undergoing active development. Finally, `1.1-xerces` contains any xerces-j specific validation XSD files which might contain error messages. (actually these 1.1-xerces files have not been commited yet but can be found here: https://github.com/olac/olac/tree/master/web/register/scripts-1.1 )
